# Land Model Validation Suite

This repository assembles a set of land surface simulations.

Each directory is a case of the simulations, containing a set of configurations, initial conditions, static parameters, forcing data, and optionally validation data.

- [`bondville`](bondville) is a plot-scale simulation. It serves as a tutorial. You can also build you own simulations on top of it.

Go into each directories for details.

Contributions of new simulations are warmly welcome.
